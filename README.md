# calculator-frontend
 ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share that I've successfully completed my project for the Codsoft Internship Program in Web Development! ðŸš€âœ¨ I designed and developed a dynamic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing Visual Studio Code as my primary tool. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in front-end development and problem-solving.
